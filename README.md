## Development

Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the development server
```bash
$ npm start
```

Some files need to be bundled together because they require npm dependencies. The entry point for the `bundle.js` generated by `webpack` is `src/scripts/services/ethereum.js`, it is the Angular service in charge of providing an interface to interact with `web3`.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

_Don't worry about the warnings, is just regular behavior of the uglyfier_

If you want to watch the file changes for development.

```bash
$ npm run build:dev
```
